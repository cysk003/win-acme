# win-acme

This is a ACMEv2 client for Windows that aims to be very simple to start with, but powerful enough to grow into almost every scenario.

* A very simple interface to create and install certificates on a local IIS server
* A more advanced interface for many other use cases, including Apache and Exchange
* Automatically creates a scheduled task to renew certificates when needed
* Get certificates with wildcards (*.example.com), international names (证书.example.com), OCSP Must Staple extension (optional).
* Re-use private keys for DANE, use EC crypto or bring your own CSR
* Advanced toolkit for DNS, HTTP and TLS validation: SFTP/FTPS, acme-dns, Azure, Route53, Cloudflare and many more…
* Store your certificates where and how you want them: Windows, IIS Central Store, .pem files, .pfx file or KeyVault
* Compatible with all popular ACME services, including Let’s Encrypt, ZeroSSL, DigiCert, Sectigo, Buypass, Keyon and others…
* Completely unattended operation from the command line
* Other forms of automation through manipulation of .json files
* Write your own Powershell .ps1 scripts to handle installation and validation
